# election-2018-forecast

Here is my forecast.  Republicans do surprisingly well.  The Nationalist message has gained much more traction in swing states than individuals in the Northeast recognize.  The negative publicity relating to personal issues regarding many Republican seat-holders in Congress has been demonstrated in this past year to have little to no effect in altering current Republican voters.

The Democrats will do better with young voters though, and this number will increase by a larger percentage than it has in years past.  Because of this, the forecasts will not be entirely off, and Democrats will do as well as they had hoped in this regard.  It won't outweigh the drastic underestimation of the Nationalist message in areas of the country that don't contain people who write these political forecasts.  

People are also now less likely than ever to register as Republican, so the pre-registration statistics will be skewed.  Unfortunately, I predict Republicans will retain the senate and win control of the house in a major surprise to most news outlets everywhere.
